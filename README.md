# Simple Pay Later

As a pay later service we allow our users to buy goods from a merchant now,
and then allow them to pay for those goods at a later date.

## Running

```sh
$ cd pay-later-go
$ go build && ./pay-later-go
```

I have added pre-created binaries for linux and macos which you may try to
use in case you don't want to compile.
