# Simple Pay Later

As a pay later service we allow our users to buy goods from a merchant now,
and then allow them to pay for those goods at a later date.

## Running

### Go Solution
```sh
$ cd pay-later-go
$ go build && ./pay-later-go
```

I have added pre-created binaries for linux and macos that you can try with if
you don't want to compile

* linux (pay-later-linux)
* macos (pay-later-macos)

### Rust Solution

```sh
$ cd pay-later-rs
$ cargo run
```
